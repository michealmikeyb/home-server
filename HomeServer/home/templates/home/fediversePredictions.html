  <section id="humble-beginnings">
    <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
    <p>The fediverse currently refers to a network of servers and users based off the activitypub protocol. It was created in 2018 as a method to decentralize the currently centralized social media landscape by federating it, much like email, where multiple servers can send and receive messages following a standard format or protocol. Apps using this protocol were made to mimic the format of centralized social media, lemmy for reddit, mastodon for twitter, pixelfed for instagram etc. These apps failed to gain much traction for many years until mounting problems began to take hold in the centralized services as interest rates rose and the companies running them began to try to turn a profit. The largest exodus came from twitter to mastodon after Elon Musk took over and began to make many controversial decisions for the platform, this combined with Musk’s increasingly right wing leanings lead a small but measurable exodus to mastodon. Twitter still remained magnitudes larger than mastodon though.</p>

    <h3>Twitter's Problems</h3>
    <p>Twitter’s problems began before Musk took over but we’re exasperated after. Twitter was stagnant for a long time prior to the take over. Its days of growth were over and it had a steady user base but wavered on profitability. The extremely political nature of twitter made it a hard pitch to advertisers, they we’re forced to play a balancing act between advertisers wanting more radical and extreme voices tempered and, a public, mostly on the right, wanting it to be a free speech platform. Because of this the stock holders were all to eager to sell to Musk when he made his bid, and would eventually force his hand in following through. It was a leveraged buyout so he was forced to take out a large loan to buy the company. The cost to service this loan plus an immediate exodus of key advertisers forced Musk to take drastic measures to keep his head above water, first cutting large swaths of the twitter staff then trying new methods of monetization, most notably the twitter blue premium subscription. These combined to degrade the user experience of twitter with trust broken by a pay to play verification system and intermittent blackouts caused by lack of staff. Still with all of this twitter kept most of its core user base as they were tied to the social network of followers they had built up over many years.</p>

  <section id="meta-enters">
    <h3>Meta Enters</h3>
    <p>In this atmosphere of disdain for twitter meta saw an opening. Coming off the failed metaverse they we’re looking for something to expand into, and they saw it in the last major social media format they hadn’t gotten their hands on. They had to be careful though, there’s are reasons meta never bought twitter, even though they could have many times over. One of them is that they risk anti-trust litigation. Even if they were able to get it past the FTC they would still have to deal with a congress backed by an american populace extremely skeptical of meta and looking for any excuse to break it up. The other reason is twitter was not that desirable of a platform, meta would have to ride that same line between advertiser friendly content and free speech platform. They already deal with this with facebook and don’t want to fight the moderation battle for a platform that won’t even be profitable. The solution to these two problems would come with federation</p>

  <section id="embrace-extend">
    <h3>Embrace Extend</h3>
    <p>With meta’s entrance into the fediverse there have been a lot of worries in the fediverse about their intention. Many believe this is part of an ‘embrace, extend, extinguish’ strategy, a strategy made by microsoft to take open standards, add proprietary features that are not open, forcing people onto microsoft’s implementation of the standard. The problem with this theory is while microsoft did try this, it never worked. The two main targets of this were email and internet browsers, both of these remained open though after multiple legal battles and anti-trust suits stopped microsoft from doing anything. This is why google, microsoft’s successor in these two fields with gmail and chrome controlling large parts of the market, doesn’t follow this paradigm and keeps them open. Meta knows this too and will try to keep to the standard to avoid any more eyes on their increasingly monopolistic position. They’ll tolerate 10% of users on mastodon if it means they avoid he fate of standard oil.</p>

  <section id="free-speech-for-all">
    <h3>Free Speech for All</h3>
    <p>The problem of content moderation has been a divisive one within the internet as these large platforms emerged. The capitalistic ad based platforms tend to want to err on the side of over moderation. Not only do problematic users such as political extremists, bigots and sex workers scare off advertisers, lowering revenue, they also increase costs in terms of moderation. It costs to moderate and take down individual posts by these groups to address legal liability in ensuring there are no threats of violence and that any sex work is consensual, as well as public liability in platforming offensive posts. This forces them to ban these forms of expression as well as the people posting it. This leads to large backlash, especially on the American right wing, on grounds of free speech and censorship. Along with this sex workers and political extremists give larger engagement on the platform so banning them causes lower usage. The solution to this is to ban them from the central server but allow them to continue posting on a different server which the central server has no liability for. The platform still gets the same engagement as it would without the liability of hosting offensive and possibly illegal content.</p>

  <section id="rise-of-threads">
    <h3>Rise of Threads</h3>
    <p>As of writing this meta’s threads launched yesterday. According to Zuckerberg has said that over 30 million people have already signed up, already passing mastodon’s high watermark by a large margin. Currently it does not support federation but they are stating that they still plan to. From here on will be speculation. Threads will eventually federate to activity pub in a matter of months for the reasons I mentioned above. Threads will by far be the largest server on the fediverse. Twitter will keep on the same trajectory and diminish to the rising threads. Eventually twitter will federate too, recognizing its inability to handle the load it once did and resigning itself to a seat in an oligopoly with meta over the short text social media market. A cultural divide will emerge between the two large instances as threads becomes the server for the moderate liberals and twitter becomes a platform for the right.</p>

    <h3>Can It Handle the Truth</h3>
    <p>It has been three years since Trump incited an insurrection with the main consequence to him being he was temporarily kicked off the major social media platforms. He took refuge in his own social media platform truth social where he could continue to foster his cult of personality without any moderation. Trump faces a problem though, the last hold out twitter has reinstated his account so he has to choose between staying on his own social media platform or abandoning it for the larger audience he has on twitter. The rise of threads though gives him a third option, he can federate. Truth social is a copy of mastodon rebranded with some features added on top. Currently it runs as an isolated server, with no access to the wider fediverse but could federate with some minor changes. Trump could federate with threads and meta could allow him to transfer his followers onto truth social. Meta would get the engagement that comes with Trump and his followers without the liability of hosting them and Trump could keep control of his platform while being able to reach his large following on instagram.</p>

  <section id="robotic-balkanization">
    <h3>Robotic Balkanization</h3>
    <p>As smaller servers pop up to cater to different communities federation politics will become a thing. Left leaning servers will defederate (users on the server won’t see posts from) truth social and vice versa. This will lead to increasing political polarization as the opposition becomes more and more invisible. This will be further exasperated by bots on the server, powered by chatgpt, indistinguishable from people and manipulating the discourse for opaque mysterious agents. These bots will both act to boost content favorable to some agenda as well as be strawmen to give a distorted and malignant image of the opposition. Truth social will be the largest of these and will increasingly disconnect from reality as more and more people are silenced on the main servers and move to it.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="the-final-election">
    <h3>The Final Election</h3>
    <p>This full system will be in full force by the 2024 election. The election will be a repeat of the 2020 election with Biden going up against Trump. Like in 2020 Trump will play up election conspiracies prior to the vote, conspiracies that instead of being dampened by the central platforms will be amplified by the reactionary truth social. The official outcome for the election will be the same, Biden winning by carrying the coasts and metropolitan midwest. Trump will continue to claim fraud and his base ,heavily animated by truth social, will demand litigation and recounts. When these fail republican states, starting with Florida, will refuse to send electors. The electors who are sent will confirm Biden, but the republican states will use their absence as justification for not recognizing Biden. One by one the deep red states will secede and a new confederacy will be born, with the capital in Dallas. Neither side will be willing to fight for the union and both will offer incentives for political refugees to settle to win the PR battle. The new confederacy will spiral into increasingly absurd reactionary policies while it is hollowed out by business interests while the remaining U.S. will mostly remain the same with a slightly more left tilt. Federation will be the cause of confederation.</p>
